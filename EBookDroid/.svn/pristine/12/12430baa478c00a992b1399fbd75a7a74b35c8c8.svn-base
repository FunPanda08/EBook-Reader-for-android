book dress (realistic)
---------------------
270x380 - 
make realistic leather, old style, add a bit of shadow

possible future expansion:

can be made in different colors (for different file types - for example golden back for favorites)

can be made in different thicknesses (from small, normal, huge books - it helps to differentiate them, more or less as it happens in real life "no, it's the big one!")

the upper (and lateral) part can be made in three versions too: vanilla, with bookmark (if the book has bookmarks) and with note (if the book has notes - possible future enhancement).



Arrows
------
They will be in the same wooden texture as the bookshelf, just carved in (or bulging out)

Bookshelf
--------
can be made in different colors (oak, cherry, fir) for different bookshelf contents (favorites, searches and recent, folders)
